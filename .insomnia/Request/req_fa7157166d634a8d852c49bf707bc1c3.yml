    and mutations used with the Shopify Storefront API.\\n\\n# If not already

    arning-kit\\n\\n# The Shopify Storefront API gives you full creative control
    to customize your customers' buying experience.\\n\\n# With the Storefront
    API you can access several Shopify resource types with the following access
    scopes:\\n# - Read products, variants, and collections.\\n# - Read and
    modify customer details.\\n# - Read and modify checkouts.\\n# - Read store
    content like articles, blogs and comments.\\n# - Read subscription selling
    plans.\\n# - Read and modify cart objects.\\n\\n# Unlike the Admin API, the
    Storefront API is an unauthenticated API.\\n# Any data exposed by the
    Storefront API can be seen by any visitor to the store.\\n# Only use the
    Storefront API when you're comfortable with that risk and the data that is
    being exposed.\\n# Risk can be mitigated by only providing access scopes
    required.\\n# For a complete list of access scopes consult Shopify
    documentation at
    https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes#unauthenticated-access-scopes\\n\
    \\n# Access to the Storefront API can be granted by a merchant via a public
    sales channel, or by creating a Headless channel in your Shopify Admin.\\n#
    For simplicity of this tutorial, we'll create a Headless channel in the
    Shopify Admin.\\n# The process to add the Headless channel is documented in
    the next section titled \\\"Installing the Headless Channel \\\".\\n\\n#
    Documentation for accessing the Storefront API using the Headless channel
    can be found
    [here](https://shopify.dev//custom-storefronts/building-with-the-storefront\
    -api/getting-started#step-1-enable-storefront-api-access)\\n\\n# The home of
